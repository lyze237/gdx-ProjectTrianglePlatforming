# What's this?

The library is a simple tool to convert Tiled object layers or collision tile layers to Box2D Bodies.
Additionally, on top of that the library takes care of a lot of complicated things:
* Proper scaling
* Triangulation of bigger polygons
* Merging of tile collisions to reduce ghosting issues
